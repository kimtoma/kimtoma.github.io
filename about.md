Hello. My name is Kyungsoo Kim. :-)

I’m currently working as a UX designer on the [NC Soft](http://kr.ncsoft.com/korean/?ref=kimtoma) AI Service Design Team.
During the past 10 years I’ve worked as a UX designer at [HNINE](https://www.hnine.com/?ref=kimtoma). 

In my spare time I enjoy side-projects that far from the money making, likes [Momat Line Stickers](https://store.line.me/stickershop/author/525306/en), [Playlisteem.](https://playlisteem.web.app/)
